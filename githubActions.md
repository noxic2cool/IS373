## What are GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that allows you to create workflows for your GitHub repository. You can automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying your code.

## Key Concepts
1. Workflow: A defined process consisting of one or more jobs. Workflows are stored in your repository under `.github/workflows/`.

2. Job: A set of steps that execute on the same runner. Jobs can run in parallel or sequentially, depending on dependencies.

3. Step: An individual task that is executed as part of a job. Steps can run commands or use actions.

4. Action: A reusable unit of code that can be used in workflows. You can create your own or use existing ones from the GitHub Marketplace.

5. Event: An occurrence that triggers a workflow, such as a push, pull request, or a scheduled time.

## Getting Started
1. Create a Workflow File
* In your GitHub repository, create a directory called `.github/workflows/.`
* Inside that directory, create a YAML file (e.g., `ci.yml`).
### Example of a basic workflow
    name: Node.js CI
    
    on:
      push:
        branches:
         - main
      pull_request:
        branches:
         - main
         
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        
      steps:
      - name: Check out code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'
        
      - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
      
      - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

## Key Components of the Workflow
* `name`: The name of the workflow.
* `on`: Specifies the events that trigger the workflow. Here, it triggers on pushes and pull requests to the main branch.
* `jobs`: Contains the jobs that will run in the workflow.
* `runs-on`: Specifies the type of runner (virtual machine) to use.
* `steps`: The individual tasks within the job.
## Common Actions
* Check Out Code: `actions/checkout@v2` allows you to pull down your repositoryâ€™s code.
* Setup Node.js: `actions/setup-node@v2` helps set up Node.js on the runner.
* Docker Build: You can use Docker to build images.

## Conclusion
GitHub Actions is a versatile tool for automating your development workflows. By leveraging workflows, jobs, and actions, you can streamline processes like testing and deployment, making your development lifecycle more efficient.
