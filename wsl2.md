# What is WSL2?
WSL2 is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10 and later. It enables users to run a full Linux kernel alongside their Windows installation.

# Setting Up WSL2

1. Installation:
* Ensure Windows is updated (Windows 10 version 2004 and higher).
* Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

`wsl --install`

* This command installs WSL and sets WSL2 as the default version.

2. Choosing a Linux Distribution:
* After installation, choose a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) from the Microsoft Store.

3. Accessing WSL:
* Open your chosen Linux distribution from the Start Menu.
