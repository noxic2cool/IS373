## Blade: 
My takeaways from this project were really getting my feet wet in GitHub again. I used it before for other classes of mine, but those classes were more so focused on using them for just uploading files instead of the collaboration efforts that it has. I also learned more about kernels, docker, etc. especially after I was encouraged to have concern for what theyare as they may come up in my field of work.

## Jeanpaul: 
This assignment has helped me learn how collaboratively work with GitHub. My main takeaway is learning how to work as a team, get familiar again with github commands, and learn how to fork/merge branches with other contirbutors. I learned vital information like virtualization, why its important and how its useful, and the differences between wsl2 and virtualbox. I also learned how to do a few commands on GitHub to make an index/table of contents in the Read Me. I'm not yet fully efficient or knowledgeable in the field, but hopefully by the end of the semester I will be.
