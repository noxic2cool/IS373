# What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is the creation of a virtual version of something, such as a server, operating system, storage device, or network resources. It allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, enabling better resource utilization, isolation, and flexibility.

# Importance of Virtualization

* Resource Efficiency: Maximizes hardware usage by running multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical machine.

* Isolation: Provides a secure environment where applications can run without affecting the host system or other VMs.

* Testing and Development: Facilitates safe testing of software and applications in a controlled environment.

* Scalability: Makes it easy to scale applications and infrastructure according to demand.

* Cost Savings: Reduces the need for physical hardware, leading to lower costs in terms of hardware, power, and maintenance.
